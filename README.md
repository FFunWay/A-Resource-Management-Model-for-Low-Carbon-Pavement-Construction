# A-Resource-Management-Model-for-Low-Carbon-Pavement-Construction

## 1. Background and Motivation
### 1.1 Motivation
Sidewalks are essential urban infrastructure, yet their pavement structures, materials, and construction methods lead to an enormous number of feasible combinations. Each combination differs in cost, carbon emissions, structural strength, and drainage performance.
However, during the design stage, engineers often lack a systematic decision framework to compare these trade-offs quantitatively. As a result, low-carbon potential is rarely considered proactively.

International practice emphasizes carbon footprint assessment during the design stage, where reduction potential can reach up to 50 percent. In contrast, carbon audits in Taiwan are mostly conducted after project completion, when design decisions are already fixed and emission reduction opportunities are extremely limited.
### 1.2 Background
In real sidewalk projects, pavement decisions are constrained by engineering requirements such as structural strength, drainage capacity, budget limits, and maintenance considerations.
Without a standardized optimization framework, material selection is usually based on experience rather than systematic analysis, making it difficult to balance carbon reduction and construction feasibility.
### 1.3 Problem Definition
This study proposes a resource management decision model that optimizes sidewalk pavement material allocation by minimizing expected carbon emissions under cost and engineering constraints during the design stage.
