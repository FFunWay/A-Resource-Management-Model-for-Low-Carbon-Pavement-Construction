# A-Resource-Management-Model-for-Low-Carbon-Pavement-Construction

## 1. Background and Motivation
Sidewalks are essential urban infrastructure, yet their pavement structures, materials, and construction methods lead to an enormous number of feasible combinations. Each combination differs in cost, carbon emissions, structural strength, and drainage performance.
However, during the design stage, engineers often lack a systematic decision framework to compare these trade-offs quantitatively. As a result, low-carbon potential is rarely considered proactively.

International practice emphasizes carbon footprint assessment during the design stage, where reduction potential can reach up to 50 percent. In contrast, carbon audits in Taiwan are mostly conducted after project completion, when design decisions are already fixed and emission reduction opportunities are extremely limited.
